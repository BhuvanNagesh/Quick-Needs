# Quick-Needs
Front-End of a Local Vendor Grocery Website
The below is one of my hackathon projects.
The idea is to upscale the profits of the local vendors who were our main target.
The Features include:
--Easy and user-friendly user interface for both the customer and vendor.
--Registration of customer should happen only with the concent of the vendor.
--Time slot feature:- Customer can contact the vendor and make certain montly weekly plans for delivery of those items at certain time slots.
